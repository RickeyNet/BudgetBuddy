/**
 * BudgetBuddy — Debt Storage Utility
 * File: src/storage/debtStorage.ts
 *
 * Handles all persistent storage operations for debt data.
 * Uses AsyncStorage (key-value store on-device) for offline-first operation.
 *
 * Design decisions:
 * - All debts are stored as a single JSON array under one key for fast reads.
 * - Writes are atomic — the entire array is replaced on each update.
 * - This is efficient for typical use (< 50 debts) and avoids key fragmentation.
